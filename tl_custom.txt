{QUESTION}
Why is my *asterisk text* showing up as bold? AM ANGERY FIX PLS >:(
{KEYS}
markdown
bold
asterisk
actiontext
{VALUE}
With the recent update to Telegram Android, Markdown is now supported. This means that text with *asterisks* around it will become bold, and text with _underscores_ around it will become italic. We have become aware that some of our users use *asterisk* text to denote that they're doing some sort of action (such as when role playing), and aren't happy with this change.

We as volunteers have suggested a "Disable Markdown" option or similar to the developer of the Android app, but since we're only volunteers we can't guarantee anything will change.

Here are a couple of workarounds we have come up with:
- If you wrap your text ***like this*, it will still show normally with one asterisk (e.g. ***text* will become *text*)
- You could use _underscores_ to denote an action, since the text will become italic. This is similar to a `/me` command in some other messengers.

{QUESTION}
I accidentally reported a group I didn't want to report. Help!
{KEYS}
accidentalreport
accreport
groupreport
{VALUE}
If you accidentally reported or left a group you wanted to stay in, you have a couple of options:

- Ask the group owner for an invite link if you know them. They can get this link from the group's profile, then Add Members, then Invite to Group via Link.
- Get a mutual contact, meaning you have their phone number and you have theirs, to invite you back to the group.

"Telegram Gold" is a hoax. Any sticker packs claiming that you need "Telegram Gold" to view them are just the same image over and over again.

Making money will never be a goal for Telegram — but if we do ever run out of funds, we may introduce some paid non-essential options. But that won't be for a while. Check out the FAQ for more: https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this

There isn't a way to set your status to "offline" or "invisible" to everyone at the moment. You can block a user and you will appear as "last seen a long time ago" to them, though. Ask me if you'd like to know about blocking on Telegram.

Sorry for the delay, we are volunteers and we do not always have people on. We also receive many messages each day, much more than we have volunteers for, so we are not able to respond to everyone in support chat.

{VALUE}
If you want to upgrade your group to a supergroup, go to Group Info and choose 'Upgrade to Supergroup'. This action is irreversible, sorry — so please consider all the differences below, and ask me if anything is unclear, before you upgrade.

Here is some info to consider before upgrading:

Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history, so deleted messages will disappear for everyone, and ordinary members can only delete their own messages.

Here's some extra information on how supergroups work:
- The entire message history is visible to new members that join the chat.
- They are muted by default and send fewer joined/left notifications.
- Admins can use pinned messages, displayed at the top of the chat, to inform members about important news that they might otherwise miss.
- They can be made public by setting a Username, just like channels.
- If made public, members can invite new people, if not, they can only join via invite link or if added by admins.

Go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number - done!
