{QUESTION}
Jesus christ Telegram is down what the hell do I do?????
{KEYS}
tdown
{VALUE}
Telegram is currently experiencing data center issues at the moment: https://twitter.com/telegram/status/990474364108894209

Even if you are not in one of the affected regions, media you are trying to access may be stored on the data centers that are down, so they will be inaccessible. As volunteers, we are not sure of any technical details regarding this issue, or any ETA, sorry. Please make sure to follow us on Twitter for any updates: twitter.com/Telegram

{QUESTION}
Is there dark mode/themes on iOS?
{KEYS}
darkios
themesios
themeios
themei
themesi
{VALUE}
At the moment, there is no way to enable a "dark mode" or to make your own theme on Telegram for iOS, although this is definitely a possibility in the future!

If you wish to use themes, you could use either our desktop or Android app; they have support for themes.

But our alpha Swift app does have early support for a dark theme, if you wish to try it out. But please do note that this is an alpha version of the app, and not everything will work at times. Here's the link: https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/c6f5a76f5c364ac89a98b77671ef2d63

To enable the dark theme, go to Settings and choose the dark wallpaper.

{QUESTION}

{KEYS}

callissue
{VALUE}
Hello! Sorry for the inconvenience. This is a known issue will be fixed in a later version of the app. For now, you can work around this by signing out and back in again.

Thank you for your patience! #issue_HDLL3LzY

{QUESTION}
Why can't others post in my channel?
{KEYS}
cg
channelgroup
channelconfused
{VALUE}
Channels are tools for broadcasting information to large numbers of people, and they can only be posted to by the admins of the channel.

If you are looking for a tool where everyone can discuss, you may want to use groups instead. To create a group on iOS, start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Chats), then 'New Group'.

Each group can have up to 10000 members in Telegram.

{QUESTION}
How do I disable the sticker/emoji panel on TDesktop?
{KEYS}

emojipanel

{VALUE}
To disable the sticker/emoji/gif panel on TDesktop, simply press the emoji icon that appears next to the microphone icon near the bottom-right. You can also click this emoji icon again if you ever want the panel back.

{QUESTION}
How do I withdrawl money?
{KEYS}
moneybot
{VALUE}
As a general note, bots are made by third-party users and not Telegram. Due to this, us volunteers can't really help you with requests specific to certain bots. Sorry about that! You might be able to ask a friend or use a /help command within the bot to receive support for the bot, though.

Also, you may want to be careful with bots that handle money, as it is very risky to let an unknown third-party perform these types of transactions on your behalf, especially when they have no former reputation. Telegram has recently released its own bot payments API with version 4.0 of the app, so that you can securely transfer money to bots. If a bot isn't using this API, then I personally would be pretty suspicious of it.

If you suspect a Telegram bot is performing illegal activities involving monetary transactions (such as pyramid schemes), please do contact abuse@telegram.org with all the details such as the bot's username and some screenshots. As we are only volunteers, we are not trained to deal with illegal cases like these. Thank you for helping make Telegram a safer place!

{QUESTION}
How do I report a user in Telegram? (Not illegal content - simply reporting)
{KEYS}
reportu
reportuser
{VALUE}
If you need to report a user, there are several ways to do so:

- If the user that you would like to report contacted you first and you are not a contact with them, there may be a "Report" button at the top of your chat with them. Tap that, select the appropriate report reason if it gives you the option, and they will be reported.
- If the report button above doesn't appear, you may then report them to abuse@telegram.org. Make sure to include your phone number, your username (if applicable), their phone number/username (if you have it), and some screenshots of evidence for why they are being reported.

Thank you!

{QUESTION}
How do I listen to music on Telegram?
{KEYS}
music
listenmusic
songs
{VALUE}
To listen to a track that was sent to you on Telegram, simply tap the play button on the message and the song will play.

As to where to find music, I am personally not sure. You could ask around or google for Telegram channels that send music. You could also use this bot (it was not made nor endorsed by Telegram) that helps you find music on Spotify: @SpotifyBot

{QUESTION}
idk what to put for question
{KEYS}
notsure
{VALUE}
I'm not sure what you mean, could you please elaborate?

{QUESTION}
I see that Telegram is only interested in making better for users and ignores updates for admins, I think it's already time to make the feature of giving over a channel to another account, and make that Android should be able to watermark a video, and make pinned messages on a channel, and to make that only the Admins should be able to see who posted on the channel,and so on.

Telegram admins feel like they are the only one's that are out of the picture, Telegram helps everyone except the Admins
{KEYS}
admincomplaints
{VALUE}
Hey there,

We hear you. I will pass your suggestions on how to make administrative tools better for channel and supergroup administrators to the Telegram team, and while we can't promise anything, these features will definitely be considered for a future release.

Thanks for your suggestions!

{VALUE}
Voice calls are not enabled yet for US users. Telegram is making sure that calls will work for everyone, so they're doing a slow rollout of calls, and they will be available to US users soon! More information here: https://telegram.org/blog/calls

{QUESTION}
Why is my *asterisk text* showing up as bold? AM ANGERY FIX PLS >:(
{KEYS}
markdown
bold
asterisk
actiontext
{VALUE}
With the recent update to Telegram Android, Markdown is now supported. This means that text with *asterisks* around it will become bold, and text with _underscores_ around it will become italic. We have become aware that some of our users use *asterisk* text to denote that they're doing some sort of action (such as when role playing), and aren't happy with this change.

We as volunteers have suggested a "Disable Markdown" option or similar to the developer of the Android app, but since we're only volunteers we can't guarantee anything will change.

Here are a couple of workarounds we have come up with:
- If you wrap your text ***like this*, it will still show normally with one asterisk (e.g. ***text* will become *text*)
- You could use _underscores_ to denote an action, since the text will become italic. This is similar to a `/me` command in some other messengers.

{QUESTION}
I accidentally reported a group I didn't want to report. Help!
{KEYS}
accidentalreport
accreport
groupreport
{VALUE}
If you accidentally reported or left a group you wanted to stay in, you have a couple of options:

- Ask the group owner for an invite link if you know them. They can get this link from the group's profile, then Add Members, then Invite to Group via Link.
- Get a mutual contact, meaning you have their phone number and you have theirs, to invite you back to the group.

{QUESTION}
What is Telegram Gold?
{KEYS}
gold

telegramgold
whatistgold
whatistelegramgold
{VALUE}
"Telegram Gold" is a hoax. Any sticker packs claiming that you need "Telegram Gold" to view them are just the same image over and over again.

Making money will never be a goal for Telegram — but if we do ever run out of funds, we may introduce some paid non-essential options. But that won't be for a while. Check out the FAQ for more: https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this

{VALUE}
Here's one way you can save a conversation:

You could use a bot such as @MessagesPDFBot (note: this bot is unofficial and not created by the Telegram team) to turn your messages into a PDF document. From there, you could print it, save it to your hard drive, etc.

There isn't a way to set your status to "offline" or "invisible" to everyone at the moment. You can block a user and you will appear as "last seen a long time ago" to them, though. Ask me if you'd like to know about blocking on Telegram.

{COMMENT}
Thanks (again) to @nullvalue.

{KEYS}

{VALUE}
Sorry for the delay, we are volunteers and we do not always have people on. We also receive many messages each day, much more than we have volunteers for, so we are not able to respond to everyone in support chat.

converttosupergroupios
converttosupergroupdesktop
convertosupergroupandroid
{VALUE}
If you want to upgrade your group to a supergroup, go to Group Info and choose 'Upgrade to Supergroup'. This action is irreversible, sorry — so please consider all the differences below, and ask me if anything is unclear, before you upgrade.

Here is some info to consider before upgrading:

Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history, so deleted messages will disappear for everyone, and ordinary members can only delete their own messages.

Here's some extra information on how supergroups work:
- The entire message history is visible to new members that join the chat.
- They are muted by default and send fewer joined/left notifications.
- Admins can use pinned messages, displayed at the top of the chat, to inform members about important news that they might otherwise miss.
- They can be made public by setting a Username, just like channels.
- If made public, members can invite new people, if not, they can only join via invite link or if added by admins.

{QUESTION}

If you ever get a new number in the future, please follow these steps to update your Telegram account with the new number:

Go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number - done!

{QUESTION}
I tapped a button on a custom keyboard and now I'm limited.
{KEYS}
customkeyboard
ckeyboard
ck
{VALUE}
Hello! Sorry about this, it seems spammers have started to utilize custom keyboards with their own custom bots. Custom keyboards, in a nutshell, allow bot developers to create their own custom buttons that, when tapped, send the content of those buttons. While these keyboards are usually used for good (to enable bot functionality), they can also be abused. Our spam and abuse team is aware of the issue and are working to prevent this.

In the meantime, please talk to @spambot to appeal your restrictions. My advice is, until it is fixed, do not tap these buttons (you can bring your normal keyboard back by tapping the keyboard button next to the paperclip).
