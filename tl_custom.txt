{VALUE}
If you want to upgrade your group to a supergroup, go to Group Info and choose 'Upgrade to Supergroup'. This action is irreversible, sorry â€” so please consider all the differences below, and ask me if anything is unclear, before you upgrade.

Here is some info to consider before upgrading:

Supergroups can have up to 5000 members. They have a unified history, so deleted messages will disappear for everyone, and ordinary members can only delete their own messages.

Here's some extra information on how supergroups work:
- The entire message history is visible to new members that join the chat.
- They are muted by default and send fewer joined/left notifications.
- Admins can use pinned messages, displayed at the top of the chat, to inform members about important news that they might otherwise miss.
- They can be made public by setting a Username, just like channels.
- If made public, members can invite new people, if not, they can only join via invite link or if added by admins.

{QUESTION}

{VALUE}
If you don't have any other way to access that Telegram account and don't have access to the SMS from the old phone number, there's no way to access your old account. Sorry.

If you ever get a new number in the future, please follow these steps to update your Telegram account with the new number:

Go to Telegram Settings > Phone number > Change number > type in your new number. If necessary, enter the code you will receive via an SMS to the new number - done!
